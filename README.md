# ETL_Project_First_Delivery
ETL project analyzing COVID-19 vaccination data in Ecuador aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being). The project evaluates territorial vaccination coverage, regional inequalities, and temporal trends using Python, a relational database, SQL, and data visualizations.

# COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Analysis in Ecuador  
### SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being  

## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 vaccination data in Ecuador to evaluate territorial coverage and health equity in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being).

The objective is to assess vaccination progress across provinces and cantons, identify potential regional inequalities, and provide data-driven insights to support public health decision-making.

The project follows a complete ETL pipeline:
- Data extraction from a CSV dataset
- Transformation and cleaning using Python
- Migration into a relational database
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization and reporting based exclusively on database queries

## 🎯 SDG Alignment

This project directly contributes to:

**SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being**
- Target 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage
- Target 3.d: Strengthen capacity for health risk management

By combining vaccination records with population data, we evaluate:
- Vaccination coverage rates by province and canton
- Progress of first, second, and booster doses
- Geographic disparities in vaccine distribution
- Temporal evolution of vaccination campaigns

## 🏗️ Architecture

The proposed ETL architecture includes:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer** – CSV dataset
2. **Transformation Layer** – Data cleaning and validation (Python)
3. **Storage Layer** – Relational Database (MySQL)
4. **Data Model** – Structured schema
5. **Analytics Layer** – SQL-based extraction
6. **Visualization Layer** – Charts and dashboards generated from DB queries (PowerBI)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Python
- MySQL
- SQL
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Power BI
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📊 Key Analyses

- Vaccination coverage rate = (total doses / population) × 100
- Comparison across regions (Coast, Sierra, Amazon)
- First vs second vs booster dose distribution
- Geographic mapping using latitude and longitude
- Temporal trends of vaccine administration

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data engineering and analytics can support global development objectives by transforming raw public health data into actionable insights aligned with the SDG framework.
